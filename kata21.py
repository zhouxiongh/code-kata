"""
Kata21: Simple Lists http://codekata.com/kata/kata21-simple-lists/
letâ€™s write three implementations of the list
- A singly linked list (each node has a reference to the next node).
- A doubly linked list (each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes).
- Some other implementation of your choosing,
except that it should use no references (pointers) to collect nodes together in the list.
